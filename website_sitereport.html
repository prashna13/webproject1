    <p>Project Overview: This report details my personal journey of developing a basic portfolio website. The primary goal of this project was to assess our ability to create a web page using HTML and CSS and manage the code using Git/GitHub. This project was focused on both technical and design processes. In the log below, I have included my entire experience, process, decisions, and challenges I faced throughout my process of creating this website.</p>

    <p>1. Initial Planning and Setup The first step was to plan the website's structure. For this project, we were instructed to create a portfolio site with five pages that included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Home page</li>
        <li>Project page</li>
        <li>Contact page</li>
        <li>Video demo page</li>
        <li>Report page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Setup: Before creating this website, I installed Sublime Text, which was the editor we were instructed to use for coding. I installed and set up Git and GitHub for version control. I also created a new repository on GitHub for this project and then created a folder on my desktop for storing everything related to my project in one place.</p>

    <p>Challenges: I didn't face many challenges during this step since everything was well instructed, but GitHub setup and learning to use command lines needed some practice.</p>

    <p>2. Design Decisions Planning how my website should look was very important before doing all of its coding. I chose a clean, minimalistic layout to keep the focus on the content, opted for a hamburger icon for mobile devices, and a multi-column layout for desktops. I also decided on a blue and white color palette throughout my website to convey professionalism and simplicity. I used different font sizes and weights to create a clear visual hierarchy and used only two fonts, sans-serif and Poppins, for my entire website to make it look more modern and consistent. I used Google Fonts to import the fonts used.</p>

    <p>Challenges: Finding the right layout, color palette, and fonts to balance visually appealing design and readability was a challenge.</p>

    <p>3. HTML Creating the entire website using HTML was the most crucial step. I used basic elements such as &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;div&gt; to adding links, making the design responsive from the start, adding pictures, and creating animations. I also created separate HTML files for structuring each page and used all the basic HTML tags taught to us to create my pages.</p>

    <p>Page Structure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Home page:</strong> The home page introduces the site's purpose (portfolio). It has a logo on the top left, a heading line, and a picture that introduces me along with a couple of lines about my work. Below that, we have two buttons, "Hire Me" and "Download My CV," which provide users easy access to view my CV and contact me for hiring.</li>
        <li><strong>Project page:</strong> This page contains details of each project I have done so far with images.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact page:</strong> This page contains a basic contact form for visitors to reach out.</li>
        <li><strong>Video Demo page:</strong> This page contains a link to a video demonstration of my website as instructed.</li>
        <li><strong>Report page:</strong> This page contains my report of this website, citations to the references taken, screenshots of validation of HTML and CSS code, and the URL to the video demo.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Challenges: Ensuring the correct use of elements and tags for the correct purpose was initially challenging. Creating a consistent structure across all pages required careful planning and attention to detail.</p>

    <p>4. CSS The use of modern design principles, responsive techniques, and consistent styling ensures a professional and accessible user experience. I focused on enhancing the websiteâ€™s aesthetics with CSS. Box-sizing includes the border and padding in the element's width and height, ensuring a consistent baseline. Flexbox was utilized throughout to create flexible and responsive layouts. I used CSS for styling each element's position, size, background color, animations, fonts, etc., through basic CSS elements such as display, align-items, color, padding, font-weight, etc. Media queries were added to make the design adaptable to various screen sizes. The toggle menu implements a hamburger menu on smaller screens for better usability on mobile screens.</p>

    <p>Challenges: Implementing a navigation menu that is both user-friendly on desktops and easily accessible on mobile devices was a challenge. One of the biggest challenges I faced during this project was creating a responsive design that works seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices. Making hover effects and transitions smooth and enhancing the user experience without causing performance issues was another challenge.</p>

    <p>Conclusion Overall, this project was both challenging and rewarding, providing valuable insights into web development and design. Key takeaways included the importance of planning, making responsive designs, UI design, and the basics of HTML and CSS. The final product demonstrates the skills and lessons I learned throughout my classes and my own learning while creating this project.</p>
